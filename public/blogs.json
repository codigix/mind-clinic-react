        "body": "Our digestive system and brain are intricately connected through the gut-brain axis, a network that communicates via hormones, neurotransmitters, and the immune system. Emerging research shows that imbalances in gut flora can directly affect anxiety, depression, and cognitive function.

        "body": "Psychobiotics are specific strains of probiotics that influence mental well-being by enhancing gut health. Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, and kimchi have shown promising results in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms. These beneficial bacteria support neurotransmitter production and immune health, regulating stress responses and mood."
