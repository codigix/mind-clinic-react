    overview: 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a chronic condition characterized by persistent, excessive worry about a variety of topics, such as personal health, work, or social interactions. This worry is often disproportionate to the actual situation and can interfere with daily life. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their anxiety and may experience physical symptoms, including muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue. GAD can be triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Research shows that around 6.8 million adults in the United States suffer from GAD, making it a relatively common anxiety disorder. It typically develops gradually and can persist for years if untreated. Long-term GAD can lead to the development of other mental health conditions, such as depression.',
